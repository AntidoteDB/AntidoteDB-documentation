# Antidote Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of AntidoteDB and all its related projects.

If you want to use Antidote as a user, try out the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md).
Sections of interest are **clients**, **deployment**, and **architecture**.

Researchers might be interested in the **benchmarking** and **tools** section.

If you are a developer, start with the **development** section of this documentation.
The **architecture** and **tools** section might also be of interest to understand AntidoteDB better.

We are continuously working on new features for AntidoteDB. 
Contact us at [info@antidotedb.com](mailto:info@antidotedb.com) if you want to know more!
